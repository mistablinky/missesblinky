# MISSES BLiNKY 0.3

Motion controlled LED earring. Depending on the motion of the earring, a nice glitter effect appears on the neopixel ring. Each pixel consists of four LEDs: red, green, blue, and warm white. While the speed of the effect is controlled by the movement, pixel position and color mix are choosen randomly. Girls like it! ;)
